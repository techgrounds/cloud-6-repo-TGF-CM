##  Assignment 3
Create a script that generates a random number between 1 and 10, stores it in a variable, and then appends the number to a text file only if the number is bigger than 5. 

If the number is 5 or smaller, it should append a line of text saying "the number is 5 or smaller" to that text file instead.

## Key Terms

I didn't come accross any new key terms in this excercise as all the terms above were covered in Bash Scripts 1 and 2.

##  Difficulties
I created the script in the wrong directory and had to move it but this proved easy enough as I've practiced it in previous assignments.

##  Results

Here is the code I used:

##  Reflection/Learning
I've learnt a lot in the past week about navigating around the CLI and trying different things.  It would be super useful to be able to generate my own code.  I need to find out if I need Bash and Python, or it it's better to focus on one and build expertise over time.
