## Subject 

Counting in Binary and Hex introduces how to convert between decimal, binary and hexadecimal.

## Assignment
Study base 2(Binary) and base 16(hexadecimal)

Convert the provided numbers from binary to decimal, decimal to binary, decimal to hex and vice versa.  See 'Results'.

## Key Terms 

Binary - in computer terms, binary refers to the notation system with 2 numbers as it's base, 1 and 0.  

Hex - this refers to the number system with 16 as it's base, so from 0 to 9 and then from A to F.  It is used to represent large numbers with fewer characters.

## Difficulties

At first if seemed complex and difficult, but once I found an explanation that was clear to me, with a bit of practice it turned out to be easy, if time consuming to convert between decimal, binary and hex.  If I had to convert in future, I would use a converter to cut back on errors and save time.

# Translate the following decimal numbers into binary:

For this excercise, I used the method where you divide the number by 2 and then keep dividing.  If the number divides evenly, the result is a 0, if the number does not divide equally, the result is a 1.  In order to read the result, you start from the last divided number and work backwards.

# Translate the following binary numbers to decimal:

For this excercise, I used the method where you start from right to left, and multiply each 1 or 0 with it's corresponding power.  So the rightmost number would be multiplied by 2 to the power of 0, the second from the right number by 2 to the power of 1, the third from the right would be multiplied by 2 to the power of 2 and so on.  As you can effectively ignore the 0's, you end up adding up the numbers created by mulitplying the 1's with their corresponding 2 to the power of x.

# Translate the following decimal numbers into hexadecimal:

The method I used here is dividing the number by 16, until the quotient is 0.  You then multiply the number after the decimal with 16 and write this down as the Remainder.  And then you convert the remainders from last to first to hexadecimal numbers to get the conversion.

# Translate the following hexadecimal numbers into decimal:

The method I used here is multiplying the hexadecimal number by 16 to the power of 0, 1, 2 etc, staring with 16 to the power of 0 from the right, then 16 to the power of 1 etc. So the positional notation system, similar to some of the methods above. 

| Hexadecimal     |  Decimal        |

| cb              | 203             | 
| 2f              | 47              |
| d8              | 216             |



## Learning and Reflection

At first it seemed very intimidating and complicated but finding the right resources that explained the methods to use made a big difference.  It feels good to understand it.
