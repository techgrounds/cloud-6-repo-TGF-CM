##  Subject
Subnetting helps to reduce network congestion by breaking a network into smaller networks or subnets.  It is a useful way to secure a network by dividing it into different parts. It also makes maintenance easier.


##  Assignment


##  Key Terms

Host - each device that requires an IP address on a network

CIDR - Classless Internet Domain Routing is a standard notation used for subnetting.

Learning/Reflection
I found the concept of subnetting logical and elegant but the execution eluded me.  I struggled to understand how the division and allocation of the addresses worked.  I moved between this subject and the other assignments and on reflection, it worked to step away and let it rest for a bit.
