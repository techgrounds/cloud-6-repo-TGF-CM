# Subject: This is an introduction to the Linux folder structure and how to navigate it
Linux has a directory structure where everything stems from /root directory.

## Assignment

Find out your current working directory.
Make a listing of all files and directories in your home directory.
Within your home directory, create a new directory named ‘techgrounds’.
Within the techgrounds directory, create a file containing some text.
Move around your directory tree using both absolute and relative paths.


## Key Terms

## commands used

pwd - print working directory. this shows which directory you are currently working in
ls - lists

ChatGPT - I tried to only use this if I couldn't find my answer another way, as it's so tempting to use but I'm concerned it actually slows down my retention of information.  It is super useful and amazing as a tutor, though it also makes silly mistakes.  



## Difficulties
I didn't understand what 'make a listing'meant - just using the ls command?

## Results

##  Learning and Reflection
It was fun seeking out commands I haven't used before.  I have more learning to do about how the directory structure works and I need to practice to navigate between different directories and files.  I enjoyed adding text in Linux as I haven't done this before.

I looked for another definition to really understand better the difference between files and directories and this one is crystal clear:

Directories:

Directories, also known as folders, are used to organize files in a hierarchical structure.
They can contain files and/or other directories.
Directories are used to categorize and manage related files.
They are represented by folder icons in file managers and by names in the command line interface.
Files:

Files are containers for data or information stored on a computer.
They can be of various types, such as text files, executable files, images, documents, etc.
Files are typically organized within directories.
Each file has a name and may have associated metadata such as permissions, size, and modification timestamp.


## Actions required:

I need to clarify with my peers about 'make a listing' to confirm I've achieved the correct result
I need to clarify for myself what absolute and relative paths are
I will do this by end of working day on 18-03-2024

##  Screenshots of assignment and list of commands used

pwd - print working directory

ls - lists all files in directory

ls -a  list all files in directory, including hidden files

ls -al lists all files in directory, including hidden files, with details

cat > filename I used this to create a textfile
