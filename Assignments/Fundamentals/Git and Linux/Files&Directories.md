##  Learning and Reflection
It was fun seeking out commands I haven't used before.  I have more learning about how the directory structure works and I need to practice to navigate between different directories and files.  I enjoyed adding text in Linux as I haven't done this before.
## Actions required:

I need to clarify with my peers about 'make a listing' to confirm I've achieved the correct result
I need to clarify for myself what absolute and relative paths are
I will do this by end of working day on 18-03-2024
