##  Assignment

Exercise 1:
Create a new script.
Create two variables x and y. Assign a numerical value to both variables.
Print the values of x and y.
Create a third variable named addup. The value of addup should be the sum of x and y.
Print the value of addup.

 Exercise 2:
Create a new script.
Create a variable called name. The value of name should be your name.
Print the text “Hello, YOURNAME!”. Use the variable name in the print statement. 


 Exercise 3:
Create a new script.
Create a variable and assign a value to it.
Print the text “Value 1: VALUE1”.
Change the value of that same variable.
Print the text “Value 2: VALUE2”.
Change the value of that same variable.
Print the text “Value 3: VALUE3”.
Example output:


##  Key Terms

Python reserved words:
These are words that has a meaning to Python and if you use them as variables, it will cause confusion and the code won't work

Operator - +, -, x and other mathematical signs that perform functions in the code

Concatenation -

##  Difficulties

Excercise 2:

When I tried to print my name, I got an error:

I had to research the different ways to get the correct output and learned about formatting strings. 

I chose the simplest way to do this by concatenating the string with the name variable.




##  Results

#  Excercise 1:

My code:
```
x = 5
y = 10
print (x)
print (y)

addup = (x + y)
print (addup)
```
Output:
```
PS C:\Users\elmar> & C:/Users/elmar/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python312/python.exe "c:/Users/elmar/Python.py/name = Elmarie.py"

#  Excercise 2:

My code:
```
name = 'Elmarie'
print ('Hello,' + name +('!'))
```
Output:
```
PS C:\Users\elmar> & C:/Users/elmar/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python312/python.exe "c:/Users/elmar/Python.py/name = Elmarie.py"
Hello,Elmarie!
```





##  Learning/Reflection
The many different ways to do things makes it difficult to retain the information.  With practice I will improve, so I need to ensure that I spend time every day coding with Python.  I will use ChatGPT to give me assignments but solve them without using ChatGPT.
