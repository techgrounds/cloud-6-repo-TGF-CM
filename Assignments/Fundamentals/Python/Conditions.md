##  Difficulties
Using if/else and elif with numbers seemed straightforward but I had to research how to get the strings into an else/if statement without syntax errors.  Once I figured out to use == to ensure the correct statements, everything else fell into place.

##  Results

### Excercise 1:

My code:
```
# ask user for their name:
who_are_you = input('What is your name?')

# if the user is Elmarie, print personalised message:
if who_are_you == 'Elmarie':
    print ('Welcome, Queen Elmarie!')
# if user is not Elmarie, print alternative messsage:
else: 
    print ('You are not the Queen! Off with your head!')
```

Output:

```
What is your name?Elmarie
Welcome, Queen Elmarie!
