## Subject
Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which unlike other Data Types that hold only single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair.

While using Dictionary, sometimes, we need to add or modify the key/value inside the dictionary.

Some examples of where you will find them are NoSQL databases or AWS/Azure resource tags. 

Dictionaries (dict) in Python also use key-value pairs to store information. 

In Python, a dictionary can be created by placing a sequence of elements within curly {} braces, separated by a ‘comma’.

The dictionary holds pairs of values, one being the Key and the other corresponding pair element being its Key:value.

Values in a dictionary can be of any data type and can be duplicated, whereas keys can’t be repeated and must be *immutable.*

## Assignment

### Exercise 1:
Create a new script.

Create a dictionary with the following keys and values:

Key

Value

First name

Casper

Last name

Velzen

Job title

Learning coach

Company

Techgrounds

Loop over the dictionary and print every key-value pair in the terminal.

##  Key Terms

*Dictionaries in Python* - Dictionaries in Python is a data structure, used to store values in key:value format. This makes it different from lists, tuples, and arrays as in a dictionary each key has an associated value.

*immutable* - In Python, an object is considered immutable if its value cannot be changed after it has been created. This means that any operation that modifies an immutable object returns a new object with the modified value.
