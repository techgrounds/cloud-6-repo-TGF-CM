1.  Create a directory called ‘scripts’. Place all the scripts you make in this directory.
2.  Add the scripts directory to the PATH variable.
3.  Create a script that appends a line of text to a text file whenever it is executed.

Unfortunately this didn't work and I got an error message.  So troubleshooting began.





## Learning/Reflection

1.  I found this on my first search for how to complete this assignment and it highlighted the purpose and future use of this assignment: 

*Your Linux PATH is how you define the directories for which commands can be run globally. In other words, if you have an executable file in a directory that is configured to be in your PATH, you can run that executable from anywhere in the Linux file structure. This is what makes it possible to run commands in /usr/bin from your home directory (or anywhere, for that matter).*
