##  Assignment 2
Create a script that generates a random number between 1 and 10, stores it in a variable, and then appends the number to a text file.

##  Key Terms

dev/urandom - randomly generates numbers, by providing an interface to the kernel's random number generator

##  Difficulties
I'm not able to generate code by myself (yet!) so I had to rely on ChatGPT as a time saving device.  I also looked at human generated code (see links above) but as the problems and solutions were usually only a part of what I had to do, I resorted to ChatGPT for assistance.

##  Results

Here is the code I used for the script:

Here is proof that a random number has been appended to a text file:
