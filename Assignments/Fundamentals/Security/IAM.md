## Subject
Identity and Access Management is one of the most fundamental concepts in cyber security and basicaklyy entails understanding how to manage access to resources and assets.

##  Assignment
Study the following:

1.  The difference between authentication and authorization.

2.  The three factors of authentication and how MFA improves security.

3.  What are the principle of least privilege is and how does it improve security?

##  Key Terms

MFA - Multi-factor identification uses multiple ways to identify for instance a password AND a cryptographic device.

### 1.  Authentication - very shortly, authentication is the process by which it is established who a user is, for example, having to enter your password for accessing your work email

Here are some examples of popular authentication techniques:

*  Password-Based Authentication
*  Passwordless Authentication
*  2FA/MFA (Two-Factor Authentication / Multi-Factor Authentication)
*  Single sign-on (SSO)
*  Social authentication

### Authorization - very shortly, authorization is more about what levels of access the user should have to information, it's about having the right permissions to access things.

Here are some popular  authorization techniques:

*  Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC)
*  JSON web token (JWT) Authorization
*  SAML Authorization
*  OpenID Authorization
*  OAuth 2.0 Authorization

### 2.   The 3 factors for authentication are:
    
  * Something you know (like a password)
  * Something you have (like a cryptographic device)
  * Something you are (like biometric eye scan)

MFA is crucial for security in business and private life as people store sensitive information online.  A password alone is not anywhere near secure enough as it can be stolen.  MFA provides additional layers of security.  Businesses use MFA to provide secure and quick access to authorised users.

### 3.The Principle of Least Privelege (PoLP) is the practice of giving users the least possible priveleges required for them to do their jobs.  This is a cyber security best practice and a safety measure to ensure the safety of assets in the following ways:

*  It reduces the surface for cyber attacks
*  Stops malware spreading
*  Helps streamline compliance and audits
