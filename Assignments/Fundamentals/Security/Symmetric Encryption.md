##  Assignment

Find one more historic cipher besides the Caesar cipher.


Find two digital ciphers that are being used today.


Send a symmetrically encrypted message to one of your peers via the public Slack channel. They should be able to decrypt the message using a key you share with them. Try to think of a way to share this encryption key without revealing it to everyone. You are not allowed to use any private messages or other communication channels besides the public Slack channel. 

Analyse the shortcomings of symmetric encryption for sending messages.

##  Key Terms

Symmetric Cipher - this is where the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt information.  It is also known as single key encryption.



Ceaser Cipher - AKA the Ceaser Shift - This is where a plain text message is encrypted by replacing each letter with a different letter of the alphabet , based on a fixed shift of the letters.  

Public key - 

Encryption - 

Decryption

##  Difficulties

##  Results

A Vigenere Cipher uses a table based on multiple Caeaser Shifts, so it makes decryption using frequency analysis much more difficult.

The three types of encryption are :

Symmetric - 

Assymetric - 

Hashing - 

Two types of digital ciphers that are in use today are:

RSA - (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) Is a digital assymetric public key
