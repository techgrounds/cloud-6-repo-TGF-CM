A Company makes daily backups of their database. The database is automatically recovered when a failure happens using the most recent available backup.

The recovery happens on a different physical machine than the original database, and the entire process takes about 15 minutes.

What is the RPO of the database?


An automatic failover to a backup web server has been configured for a website. Because the backup has to be powered on first and has to pull the newest version of the website from GitHub, the process takes about 8 minutes. 

What is the RTO of the website?
