##  Assignment

A Company makes daily backups of their database. The database is automatically recovered when a failure happens using the most recent available backup.

The recovery happens on a different physical machine than the original database, and the entire process takes about 15 minutes.

What is the RPO of the database?


An automatic failover to a backup web server has been configured for a website. Because the backup has to be powered on first and has to pull the newest version of the website from GitHub, the process takes about 8 minutes. 

What is the RTO of the website?
##  Key Terms

*IDS* -   * An IDS (Intrusion Detection System) monitors the traffic on a computer network to detect any suspicious activity.
        *  It analyzes the data flowing through the network to look for patterns and signs of abnormal behavior.
        *  The IDS compares the network activity to a set of predefined rules and patterns to identify any activity that might indicate an attack or intrusion.
        *  If the IDS detects something that matches one of these rules or patterns, it sends an alert to the system administrator.
        *  The system administrator can then investigate the alert and take action to prevent any damage or further intrusion.

*Comparison of IDS with Firewalls*
IDS and firewall both are related to network security but an IDS differs from a firewall as a firewall looks outwardly for intrusions in order to stop them from happening. 

Firewalls restrict access between networks to prevent intrusion and if an attack is from inside the network it doesnâ€™t signal. 

An IDS describes a suspected intrusion once it has happened and then signals an alarm.

IPS

Types of IPS

There are two main types of IPS:

Network-Based IPS: A Network-Based IPS is installed at the network perimeter and monitors all traffic that enters and exits the network.
Host-Based IPS: A Host-Based IPS is installed on individual hosts and monitors the traffic that goes in and out of that host.

*Difference between IPS and IDS*
When IDS detects intrusion it only alerts network administration while Intrusion Prevention System(IPS) blocks the malicious packets before it reaches to destination.

There are two main types of IPS:

Network-Based IPS: A Network-Based IPS is installed at the network perimeter and monitors all traffic that enters and exits the network.
Host-Based IPS: A Host-Based IPS is installed on individual hosts and monitors the traffic that goes in and out of that host.
