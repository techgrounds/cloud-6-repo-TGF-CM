## Subject
Azure Containers allow you to deploy and manage applications packaged in containers. Containers provide a lightweight, isolated environment for running applications, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

## Resources
- [Microsoft Azure Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/)
- [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)
- [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/)



## Practical Exercises
1. **Deploy a Simple Web App using Azure Container Instances (ACI)**
   - Create a Docker container image for a simple web application.
   - Push the Docker image to Azure Container Registry (ACR).
   - Deploy the container image to Azure Container Instances (ACI) and access the web application.

2. **Set Up and Manage a Kubernetes Cluster with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**
   - Create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.
   - Deploy a multi-container application to the AKS cluster.
   - Scale the application and manage updates to the containers.


## Assignment
This assignment aims to provide foundational knowledge about Azure Containers. Understanding this topic is crucial for the AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals exam.

## Key Terms
1. **Containerization**: A method of packaging, distributing, and running applications and their dependencies in isolated environments called containers.
2. **Docker**: A popular platform for building, sharing, and running containerized applications.
3. **Azure Container Instances (ACI)**: A service that enables you to run containers without managing the underlying infrastructure.
4. **Kubernetes**: An open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
5. **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: A managed Kubernetes service provided by Azure for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.
6. **Container Registry**: A service for storing and managing container images used in container deployments.
7. **Pod**: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, representing a group of one or more containers.
8. **Deployment**: The process of launching and managing instances of a containerized application in a container runtime environment.

2. **Azure Fundamentals Learning Path**: [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/)
3. **AZ-900 Exam Skills Outline**: [Microsoft Certification](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-900)
4. **Azure Container Instances Pricing**: [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/?service=container-instances)
5. **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Documentation**: [AKS Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/)

## Difficulties
1. **Understanding Containerization**: Beginners may struggle with the concept of containerization and how it differs from traditional virtualization or VM's
2. **Container Orchestration**: Managing and orchestrating containers effectively, especially in production environments, can be challenging without prior experience.
3. **Networking**: Configuring networking for containers and understanding how containers communicate with each other and external resources can be complex.
4. **Security**: Ensuring the security of containerized applications and managing access control require careful consideration and knowledge of best practices.

## Results
Upon completing this assignment, you should be able to:
1. Explain the concept of containerization and its benefits.
2. Understand the different Azure services available for deploying and managing containers.
3. Describe the basic components of Kubernetes and its role in container orchestration.
4. Navigate Azure documentation to learn more about container-related topics.
5. Prepare effectively for the container-related topics in the AZ-900 exam.
