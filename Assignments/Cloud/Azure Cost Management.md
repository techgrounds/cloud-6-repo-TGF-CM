A frequently mentioned advantage of the cloud is that you only pay for what you use. This concerns OPEX instead of CAPEX expenses. The “Cost Management + Billing” tool provides insight into your expenses in Azure and allows you to manage your subscriptions.

When you create a 'Free Account' or a 'Student Account', you will receive an amount from Microsoft as a gift to experiment with in Azure. Please note that after 30 days your subscription will be automatically stopped, which means that all your services that are still running will be turned off.


If you have created a 'Pay-as-you-go' subscription, there are a number of services that are always free to a certain extent. Please understand that these services are sometimes integrated with other services for which you have to pay.


Azure has the following principles to successfully reduce your costs:


*  Plan (Planning)
*  Visibility
*  Accountability
*  Optimization (Optimization)
*  Iteration
  
The Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) is used to calculate how much an infrastructure costs if it is hosted in the traditional way. 

With the TCO calculator you can compare the costs of a traditional infrastructure with the costs for the same infrastructure on Azure.
