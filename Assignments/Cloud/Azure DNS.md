## Subject
Azure DNS: An Introduction for Beginner Cloud Engineers

## Assignment
The objective of this assignment is to provide you with foundational knowledge about Azure DNS. This will help you understand the concepts required for the AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals exam.

## Key Terms
1. **DNS (Domain Name System)**: A hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the internet or a private network.
2. **Azure DNS**: A hosting service for DNS domains, providing name resolution using Microsoft Azure infrastructure.
3. **DNS Zone**: A container for DNS records for a specific domain. It allows you to manage and configure DNS settings.
4. **DNS Record**: An entry in a DNS zone file that specifies mappings between domain names and IP addresses or other resources.
5. **Name Server**: A server that handles requests to translate domain names into IP addresses.
6. **CNAME Record (Canonical Name Record)**: A DNS record that maps an alias name to a true or canonical domain name.
7. **A Record (Address Record)**: A DNS record that maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.
8. **AAAA Record**: A DNS record that maps a domain name to an IPv6 address.
9. **MX Record (Mail Exchange Record)**: A DNS record that specifies the mail servers responsible for receiving email messages on behalf of a domain.
10. **TTL (Time to Live)**: The duration in seconds that a DNS record is cached by a DNS resolver.

5. **Azure DNS - How-To Guides**: [Microsoft How-To Guides](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-how-to)

## Difficulties
1. **Understanding DNS Concepts**: Beginners may find it challenging to grasp how DNS works and its importance in the internet infrastructure.
2. **Configuring DNS Records**: Setting up and managing different types of DNS records (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX) can be confusing without practical experience.
3. **TTL Management**: Deciding appropriate TTL values for different records requires understanding the balance between performance and DNS propagation time.
4. **Azure Portal Navigation**: Navigating the Azure portal to manage DNS zones and records might be overwhelming for those new to Azure.

## Results
Upon completing this assignment, you should be able to:
1. Describe the basic concepts and importance of DNS.
2. Understand what Azure DNS is and its role in managing DNS records.
3. Identify and differentiate between various types of DNS records (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX).
4. Navigate the Azure portal to create and manage DNS zones and records.
5. Prepare effectively for the DNS-related topics in the AZ-900 exam.

Good luck with your studies and your upcoming AZ-900 exam!
