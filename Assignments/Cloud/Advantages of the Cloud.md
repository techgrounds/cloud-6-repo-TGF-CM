Azure mentions 6 benefits of cloud computing. 

These are basic properties that make the cloud interesting for companies. 

Please note that this is also a marketing tool to introduce Azure to new customers. 

That is why it is also an important part of the AZ-900 exam.

The six benefits of cloud computing are:

*  High Availability
*  Depending on the service level agreement (SLA)
*  Scalability (Both vertically and horizontally)
*  Elasticity
*  Agility
*  Geo distribution
*  Disaster recovery

  
Azure uses a consumption-based model. This means that you only pay for the resources you use. This replaces Capital Expenditure (CapEx) with Operational Expenditure (OpEx).

##  Results

1. **High Availability**:
   - Imagine you have a website or an application. High availability means that your website or app is almost always accessible and operational, even if there are technical issues or maintenance happening in the background. Azure ensures this by spreading your data and applications across multiple servers and data centers so that if one goes down, your services remain available.

2. **Depending on the service level agreement (SLA)**:
   - A service level agreement (SLA) is like a promise between you and Azure. It outlines how reliable their services will be and what happens if they don't meet those promises. Azure provides different levels of SLAs depending on the service you use. For example, they might guarantee that your services will be available 99.99% of the time. If they don't meet this, they might offer you credits or compensation.

3. **Scalability (Both vertically and horizontally)**:
   - Imagine your website suddenly becomes really popular, and lots of people are trying to use it at once. Scalability means your website can handle this increased demand without crashing. In Azure, you can scale your resources both vertically (by making your existing servers more powerful) and horizontally (by adding more servers). This ensures your website or app can handle more traffic as needed.

4. **Elasticity**:
   - Elasticity is like scalability but on autopilot. It means your resources automatically adjust based on demand. So, if your website suddenly gets a huge spike in visitors, Azure will automatically add more servers to handle the load. And when the traffic decreases, it will scale back down to save you money.

5. **Agility**:
   - Agility in Azure means you can quickly adapt and change your resources as your business needs evolve. If you want to launch a new feature or experiment with something, Azure makes it easy to do so without long delays or complex setup processes. This agility helps businesses stay competitive and respond to market changes faster.

6. **Geo distribution**:
   - Geo distribution means your data and services are spread across multiple locations or regions around the world. This is useful for businesses that have customers or users in different parts of the globe. With Azure, you can choose where your data is stored and make sure it's closer to your users, which can improve performance and reduce latency.

7. **Disaster recovery**:
   - Disaster recovery is like having a backup plan for your data and services in case something goes wrong. Azure offers tools and services to help you recover quickly from disasters like server failures, data breaches, or natural disasters. This ensures your business can keep running smoothly even in the face of unexpected events.
