##  Subject

From this moment on, you will receive fewer concrete assignments. We will rely more on your independent learning skills. Don't worry, you're not alone. You have each other, and the established structure remains where you can still ask everyone for help.

Some services you only need to know theoretically. Others you should have turned on and configured at least once. Each topic describes whether it is a theoretical or practical subject.

Useful questions to keep in mind during your research on the topics:

1.  What problem does X solve?
2.  What key terms are associated with X?
3.  How does X fit into / replace X in an on-premises setting?
4.  How can I combine X with other services?
5.  What is the difference between X and other similar services?
6.  A handy list of tasks you need to be able to perform practically:

7.  Where can I find this service in the console?
8.  How do I turn on this service?
9.  How can I connect this service to other resources?
