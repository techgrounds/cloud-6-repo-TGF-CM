### *Standard HDD (Hard Disk Drive):*

Offers the lowest cost per GB.

Provides standard magnetic hard disk drives with rotational latency and slower read/write speeds compared to SSDs.

Suitable for workloads with low I/O requirements or where cost is a primary concern.

###  *Standard SSD (Solid State Drive):*

Offers better performance than HDDs with faster read/write speeds and lower latency.

Generally more expensive than HDDs but less expensive than Premium SSDs.

Suitable for general-purpose workloads that require better performance than HDDs but do not require the highest performance offered by Premium SSDs.

###  *Premium SSD:*
Provides the highest performance with low latency and high throughput.

Uses solid-state drives (SSDs) optimized for I/O-intensive workloads.

Offers the best performance for mission-critical applications, databases, and high-performance computing.

Generally more expensive than both Standard HDDs and Standard SSDs.
