##  Subject

From this moment on, you will receive fewer concrete assignments. We will rely more on your independent learning skills. Don't worry, you're not alone. You have each other, and the established structure remains where you can still ask everyone for help.

Some services you only need to know theoretically. Others you should have turned on and configured at least once. Each topic describes whether it is a theoretical or practical subject.

Useful questions to keep in mind during your research on the topics:

1.  What problem does X solve?
2.  What key terms are associated with X?
3.  How does X fit into / replace X in an on-premises setting?
4.  How can I combine X with other services?
5.  What is the difference between X and other similar services?
6.  A handy list of tasks you need to be able to perform practically:

7.  Where can I find this service in the console?
8.  How do I turn on this service?
9.  How can I connect this service to other resources?
    
Requirements:

Your Azure environment

##  How I'm planning to structure my learning:

I requested that ChatGPT generate a tutorial for me on how to ensure that I complete this assignment as I wanted to make sure that I do it comprehensively: 

Understanding the Assignment:

The assignment requires you to gain practical experience with some Azure services while gaining theoretical knowledge of others.

Researching the Topics:
Start by understanding the purpose and functionality of each service listed in the assignment. Use the provided questions as guidelines for your research.
For practical services (Azure Files, SQL Databases in Azure, Azure App Service), focus on understanding how to use them, where to find them in the Azure portal, how to turn them on, and how to connect them to other resources.
For theoretical services (Azure CDN, Azure DNS), focus on understanding their roles, key terms, and how they integrate into Azure environments.

Practical Experience:
Begin by accessing the Azure portal and locating each service mentioned in the practical section.
Follow tutorials or documentation provided by Azure to turn on and configure each service at least once.
Experiment with connecting these services to other Azure resources to understand their integration capabilities.

Theoretical Knowledge:
Dive into documentation, tutorials, and other resources to understand the concepts behind Azure CDN and Azure DNS.
Focus on key terms, use cases, and differences from similar services.

Documentation and Troubleshooting:
Throughout your exploration, refer to Azure documentation for each service for detailed guidance.
If you encounter any issues or have questions, utilize community forums, Azure support, or peers for assistance.

Review and Reflection:
Once you've completed the practical tasks and gained theoretical knowledge, review your understanding of each service.
Reflect on how you can apply this knowledge in real-world scenarios or in your current or future projects.

Completion:
Once you feel confident in your understanding and have gained practical experience with the required services, you've completed the assignment.

##  Reflection/Learning

It was interesting to have to chart my own course and determine what I wanted to learn about each aspect that was specified in the assignment.  As the learning coach pointed out, this is to prepare for working in a team where you are responsible for your own learning.  

I enjoyed the challenge of it and from the beginning tried to set clear time goals per subject for myself.  I also built in a buffer for the inevevitable things that will require troubleshooting and that takes more time than estimated but I tried to be strict with the limits I set myself.
